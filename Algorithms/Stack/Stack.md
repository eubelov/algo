# Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.

## Complexity

- push: O(1)
- pop: O(1)
- peek: O(1)
- is empty: O(1)

> These complexities are based on the assumption that the stack is implemented using an array or a linked list

## Use cases

- Track function calls in a program
- Undo/redo operations
- Expression evaluation - Reverse Polish notation
- Balanced parentheses
- Backtracking - keep track of the state of a problem, to return to previous states if needed.
